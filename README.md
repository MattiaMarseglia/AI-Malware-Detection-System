# Malware Detection System

## Overview

Malwares are malicious software that infect digital systems, posing a major threat to digital security. They exploit system vulnerabilities, such as programming errors, to execute attacks that can cause extensive damage, including extortion through ransomware, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks using worms, and data theft via spyware.

In 2022, cyber-attacks increased significantly in both quantity and severity. The Clusit report highlighted that 32% of attacks were "critical" and 47% were "high" in severity, affecting credibility, finances, society, and geopolitics.

Malware detection is crucial in defending against these threats. Traditional techniques include Signature-Based detection and Checksumming, which compare software signatures against a database. However, these methods struggle with real-time detection of unknown malware.

Dynamic techniques, such as Behavioral detection, analyze software in a sandbox to identify malicious behavior. These methods are complex and resource-intensive.

The new frontier in malware detection leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI). Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs) are essential for effective analysis, as modern malware employs techniques like polymorphism and metamorphism to evade detection. These AI-based approaches, though time-consuming, offer enhanced detection capabilities.

This project explores Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies to classify binary files as malware or benign.

## Technologies Used

### Project Constraints and Model Selection
The project required selecting three models for malware detection, with at least one model based on machine learning. Various models were tested, ranging from deep learning image-based CNNs to natural language processing techniques. Models were evaluated based on their performance on a validation set derived from Dataset 1 using an 80-20 split. The models were selected based on accuracy, and only the top-performing models were chosen for further investigation.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
NLP involves processing text to analyze, interpret, and represent it. For malware detection, this requires extracting a corpus from binary files to analyze using NLP techniques. Specifically, API call sequences were extracted from the assembly source files using the Lief library, due to resource constraints preventing opcode extraction. These sequences were then vectorized using the Doc2Vec model, which generates word embeddings by leveraging semantic and syntactic information from the text.

### Feature Extraction: API Calls
API calls allow programs to interact with other programs through defined interfaces. In PE files, API calls interact with Dynamic-Link Libraries (DLLs). Analyzing these calls helps determine a file's behavior by examining its interactions with the operating system or common libraries. For this project, API calls were extracted from the assembly source files using the Lief library.

### Analyzed Approaches
The extracted feature vectors were initially evaluated using KNeighborsClassifier and LogisticRegression models, chosen for their ease of use and low computational complexity. The top 5 Doc2Vec models were further analyzed using a Random Forest and a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

#### Random Forest
Random Forest training involved a Random Search over parameters such as Criterion (gini, entropy), Number of estimators (10, 1000), and Maximum Depth (2, 32). The best parameters were selected based on accuracy.

#### CNN 1D
The 1D CNN model applied monodimensional convolutional layers to the vectorized output, scanning the sequence for features.

### Ensemble Classifiers
Ensemble classifiers were used to create a robust system against obfuscation, combining weak learners into a strong predictor. Approaches included Random Forests, Gradient Boosting architectures, and custom ensembles, leveraging features extracted through the EMBER framework.

### Feature Extraction: Ember Features
Given the binary nature of the datasets, pre-processing was necessary. The EMBER framework was used to convert raw data into a clean dataset for algorithm training.

### Image-Based Approaches
This technique utilized CNNs, leveraging their generalization power for tasks beyond computer vision. Binary files were converted to grayscale images by segmenting 8-bit vectors into pixels, following the methodology outlined in the literature. Different models, such as ResNet50, Inception V3, and EfficientNetV2, were tested with the generated images.

### MalConv-Based Networks
Classical machine learning approaches rely on extensive feature engineering, making them susceptible to evasion once attackers identify the features used. Treating raw binaries as images can be problematic due to loss of code structure and conflation of vertical and horizontal proximities. Instead, using an embedding space concept from NLP, MalConv was used to classify malware from raw bytes, reducing the need for constant feature engineering. This approach uses an embedding layer over an alphabet of 257 tokens, with the network analyzing files through convolutional blocks with a gating mechanism.
