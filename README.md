# Project Name: Malware Detection System

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a robust malware detection system using machine learning methodologies. The primary objectives include selecting three machine learning methodologies for malware detection, training and validating classifiers on Dataset 1, evaluating the accuracy and generalization capabilities on Dataset 1 and Dataset 2, generating obfuscated samples using basic techniques, and assessing the overall robustness of the system.

## Project Tasks

1. **Select Machine Learning Methodologies:**
   - Choose three machine learning methodologies for malware detection.

2. **Train and Validate Classifiers:**
   - Train and validate the selected classifiers on Dataset 1.

3. **Evaluate Accuracy:**
   - Assess the accuracy of the chosen methods on Dataset 1.

4. **Generalization Assessment:**
   - Evaluate the generalization capabilities of the chosen methods on Dataset 2.

5. **Generate Obfuscated Samples:**
   - Implement basic obfuscation techniques, including:
     - Packing
     - Append on the binary file with random patterns from benign files in Dataset 1
     - Addition of sections with bytes extracted from analogous sections of benign files in Dataset 1

6. **Evaluate System Robustness:**
   - Assess the robustness of the developed malware detection system.

7. **Document Experimentation:**
   - Produce a detailed document describing the experimentation process.
   - Include procedures for feature extraction, training, and validation.
   - Provide commentary on experimental results.
