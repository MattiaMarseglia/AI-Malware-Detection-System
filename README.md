# Malware Detection System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a robust system for detecting malware using machine learning and deep learning methodologies. Detecting malware is crucial due to its significant impact on cybersecurity, leading to:
- **Data Breaches and Loss**: Malware can lead to unauthorized access and theft of sensitive data, causing significant financial and reputational damage.
- **System Disruption**: Malware can disrupt system operations, leading to downtime and loss of productivity.
- **Resource Drain**: Infected systems can become slow and unresponsive, impacting overall performance.
- **Financial Loss**: The cost of dealing with malware infections can be substantial, including expenses related to recovery, fines, and loss of business.

Given these potential impacts, it is vital to develop a system that can reliably detect and respond to malware threats, ensuring the security and integrity of information systems.

Traditional malware detection techniques often rely on signature-based approaches, which can be limited in detecting new or obfuscated malware. In contrast, this project leverages machine learning and deep learning methods to improve detection accuracy and generalization, reducing the reliance on predefined signatures and enhancing the system's ability to identify novel threats.

## Proposed System

The proposed system is based on three selected methodologies from machine learning and deep learning, ensuring at least one method is based on traditional ML. The system is designed to train and validate classifiers using Dataset 1, evaluate their accuracy, test their generalization on Dataset 2, and assess their robustness against obfuscated samples generated using the GAMMA attack on the MalCONV network provided by the SECML library.

### Methodology Selection
Three methodologies are selected, including at least one from machine learning, to ensure a diverse approach to malware detection. 

### Training and Validation
Selected Classifiers are trained and validated on Dataset 1. The training process involves feature extraction and model training.

### Accuracy Evaluation
The accuracy of the selected methods is assessed on Dataset 1. This step involves comparing the performance of different classifiers and selecting the best-performing ones.

### Generalization Testing
The generalization capabilities of the selected methods are evaluated on Dataset 2. This step ensures that the classifiers can effectively detect malware in a different dataset, highlighting their robustness and versatility.

### Obfuscation and Attack
A dataset of obfuscated samples is generated using the GAMMA attack on the MalCONV network provided by the SECML library. This step tests the robustness of the classifiers against various attack intensities.

### Robustness Evaluation
The robustness of the selected classifiers is assessed against obfuscated samples. This evaluation helps in understanding the resilience of the classifiers under adversarial conditions.

### Documentation
A detailed document describing the experimentation process, including feature extraction procedures, training and validation methods, and a thorough analysis of experimental results, is produced. The documentation is available [here](MalwareDetectionandRobustnessEvaluation.pdf).
