# Project Malware Detection System

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a robust malware detection system using machine learning and deep learning methodologies. The primary goal is to develop classifiers capable of accurately identifying malware instances. The project involves the selection of three methodologies, training and validating classifiers on Dataset 1, evaluating accuracy on Dataset 1, assessing generalization on Dataset 2, and testing robustness against obfuscated samples.

## Project Objectives

1. **Methodology Selection:**
   - Choose three methodologies from both machine learning and deep learning, with at least one based on ML.

2. **Training and Validation:**
   - Train and validate classifiers using Dataset 1.

3. **Accuracy Evaluation:**
   - Assess the accuracy of the selected methods on Dataset 1.

4. **Generalization Testing:**
   - Evaluate the generalization capabilities of the selected methods on Dataset 2.

5. **Obfuscation and Attack:**
   - Generate a dataset of obfuscated samples using the GAMMA attack on the MalCONV network provided by the SECML library.

6. **Robustness Evaluation:**
   - Assess the robustness of the selected classifiers against obfuscated samples with varying attack intensities.

7. **Documentation:**
   - Produce a detailed document describing the experimentation process. This includes feature extraction procedures, training and validation methods, and a thorough analysis of experimental results.
